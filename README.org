* How to Train a GAN? Tips and tricks to make GANs work
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-train-a-gan-tips-and-tricks-to-make-gans-work
  :END:

While research in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) continues to
improve the fundamental stability of these models, we use a bunch of
tricks to train them and make them stable day to day.

Here are a summary of some of the tricks.

[[#authors][Here's a link to the authors of this document]]

If you find a trick that is particularly useful in practice, please open
a Pull Request to add it to the document. If we find it to be reasonable
and verified, we will merge it in.

** 1. Normalize the inputs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: normalize-the-inputs
   :END:

- normalize the images between -1 and 1
- Tanh as the last layer of the generator output

** 2: A modified loss function
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-modified-loss-function
   :END:

In GAN papers, the loss function to optimize G is =min (log 1-D)=, but
in practice folks practically use =max log D= - because the first
formulation has vanishing gradients early on - Goodfellow et. al (2014)

In practice, works well: - Flip labels when training generator: real =
fake, fake = real

** 3: Use a spherical Z
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-a-spherical-z
   :END:

- Dont sample from a Uniform distribution

#+CAPTION: cube
[[file:images/cube.png]]

- Sample from a gaussian distribution

#+CAPTION: sphere
[[file:images/sphere.png]]

- When doing interpolations, do the interpolation via a great circle,
  rather than a straight line from point A to point B
- Tom White's [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04468][Sampling Generative
  Networks]] ref code https://github.com/dribnet/plat has more details

** 4 Normalization 
*** 4.a Batch normalization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-batch-normalization
   :END:

- Construct different mini-batches for real and fake, i.e. each
  mini-batch needs to contain only all real images or all generated
  images.
- 

#+CAPTION: batchmix
[[file:images/batchmix.png]]

*** 4.b Layer normalization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: b-layer-normalization
   :END:

- when batchnorm is not an option use instance normalization (for each
  sample, subtract mean and divide by standard deviation).
- use spectral normalization on discriminator
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05957)

** 5: Avoid Sparse Gradients: ReLU, MaxPool
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: avoid-sparse-gradients-relu-maxpool
   :END:

- the stability of the GAN game suffers if you have sparse gradients
- LeakyReLU = good (in both G and D)
- For Downsampling, use: Average Pooling, Conv2d + stride
- For Upsampling, use: PixelShuffle, ConvTranspose2d + stride

  - PixelShuffle: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158

** 6: Use Soft and Noisy Labels
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-soft-and-noisy-labels
   :END:

- Label Smoothing, i.e. if you have two target labels: Real=1 and
  Fake=0, then for each incoming sample, if it is real, then replace the
  label with a random number between 0.7 and 1.2, and if it is a fake
  sample, replace it with 0.0 and 0.3 (for example).

  - Salimans et. al. 2016

- make the labels the noisy for the discriminator: occasionally flip the
  labels when training the discriminator

** 7: DCGAN / Hybrid Models
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dcgan-hybrid-models
   :END:

- Use DCGAN when you can. It works!
- if you cant use DCGANs and no model is stable, use a hybrid model : KL
  + GAN or VAE + GAN

** 8: Use stability tricks from RL
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-stability-tricks-from-rl
   :END:

- Experience Replay

  - Keep a replay buffer of past generations and occassionally show them
  - Keep checkpoints from the past of G and D and occassionaly swap them
    out for a few iterations

- All stability tricks that work for deep deterministic policy gradients
- See Pfau & Vinyals (2016)

** 9: Use the ADAM Optimizer
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-the-adam-optimizer
   :END:

- optim.Adam rules!

  - See Radford et. al. 2015

- Use SGD for discriminator and ADAM for generator

** 10: Track failures early
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: track-failures-early
   :END:

- D loss goes to 0: failure mode
- check norms of gradients: if they are over 100 things are screwing up
- when things are working, D loss has low variance and goes down over
  time vs having huge variance and spiking
- if loss of generator steadily decreases, then it's fooling D with
  garbage (says martin)

** 11: Dont balance loss via statistics (unless you have a good reason
to)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dont-balance-loss-via-statistics-unless-you-have-a-good-reason-to
   :END:

- Dont try to find a (number of G / number of D) schedule to uncollapse
  training
- It's hard and we've all tried it.
- If you do try it, have a principled approach to it, rather than
  intuition

For example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  while lossD > A:
    train D
  while lossG > B:
    train G
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 12: If you have labels, use them
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: if-you-have-labels-use-them
   :END:

- if you have labels available, training the discriminator to also
  classify the samples: auxillary GANs

** 13: Add noise to inputs, decay over time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: add-noise-to-inputs-decay-over-time
   :END:

- Add some artificial noise to inputs to D (Arjovsky et. al., Huszar,
  2016)

  - http://www.inference.vc/instance-noise-a-trick-for-stabilising-gan-training/
  - https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hk4_qw5xe

- adding gaussian noise to every layer of generator (Zhao et. al. EBGAN)

  - Improved GANs: OpenAI code also has it (commented out)

** 14: Train discriminator more
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: train-discriminator-more
   :END:

- especially when you have noise
- hard to find a schedule of number of D iterations vs G iterations
- train discriminator in n times using Wasserstein distance

  - also makes losses correlates with sample quality

** 15: [notsure] Batch Discrimination
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: notsure-batch-discrimination
   :END:

- Mixed results

** 16: Discrete variables in Conditional GANs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: discrete-variables-in-conditional-gans
   :END:

- Use an Embedding layer
- Add as additional channels to images
- Keep embedding dimensionality low and upsample to match image channel
  size

** 17: Use Dropouts in G in both train and test phase
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: use-dropouts-in-g-in-both-train-and-test-phase
   :END:

- Provide noise in the form of dropout (50%).
- Apply on several layers of our generator at both training and test
  time
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004v1

** 18: Sample From G History
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sample-from-g-history
   :END:

- For each batch, sample half of the images from the current generator
  and half from a history of generated images
- Section 2.3 https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07828

** 19: Historical Averaging
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: historical-averaging
   :END:

- Use a historical average of learned parameters (complements #18)
- Section 3.3 https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498
